1) Connect to my-gw-01.srv.dc2 via ssh and put command "ssh -L 8888:localhost:3306 my-private-db.srv.dc2";
2) Then on local server put command "ssh -L 9999:localhost:8888 my-gw-01.srv.dc2" and then put "mysql -u some_user -pSome_pass -h localhost _p 9999"
Or we can put "mysql -u some_user -pSome_pass -h my-gw-01.srv.dc2 -P 8888"
